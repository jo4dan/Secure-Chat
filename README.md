# Project Summary

**Secure-Chat** ðŸ”’ðŸ’¬ â€” a tiny, local-first real-time chat app built with Node.js and WebSockets.  
Itâ€™s made for learning and prototyping private messaging: run it on your machine, open a few browser tabs, and watch messages fly between clients in real time.

## What this does (plain English)
- Starts a simple Node.js server that serves a frontend and handles live chat connections.
- Lets multiple browser windows/tabs connect and send messages instantly using WebSockets.
- Designed to be lightweight so beginners can see how real-time chat works without a database or cloud setup.

## Who this is for
- Absolute beginners who want to learn how real-time apps work.
- Devs wanting a sandbox to test client-side encryption ideas.
- People who want a small project to tweak and learn Node + WebSockets.

## What you need (very small)
- Node.js installed (v14+ recommended).  
- Basic terminal / command-line knowledge.  
- A browser (Chrome/Firefox).
